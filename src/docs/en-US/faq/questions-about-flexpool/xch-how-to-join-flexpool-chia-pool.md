With your Chia Network software, join the pool using one of our pool addresses on [Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/p4apo2/flexfarmer_v10_release_nodeless_farming_on/).
Within about an hour (100-110 blocks) your join will be complete. You must use a PlotNFT and plots
made with a PlotNFT pool contract address; OG plots (made before Chia 1.2.0) or solo plots (not
made with a PlotNFT) cannot be used for the pool.
