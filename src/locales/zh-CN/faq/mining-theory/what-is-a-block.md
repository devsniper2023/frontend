最基本的一个区块是下列元素的组合:
| 区块      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 交易记录    | 来自网络的交易列表， 此列表的大小是有限的，因此只能包括一定数量的交易（可包括的交易数量因币种而异）。  Transactions also include a *Transaction Fee* which is given to the miner of the Block in exchange for including that transaction in the Block, transactions are included in blocks based on these Transaction Fees, higher fees get incorporated in Blocks faster as the miners are trying to make as much profit as possible. The transactions list includes a special transaction which gives funds to the miner of the block, these funds are "created" when the Block is broadcast to the network and is known as the *Block Reward*.                                                                                |
| 前一个区块哈希 | 区块链上前一个区块的哈希值--这确保了区块链不能被改变，因为调整前一个区块中的任何东西都会导致该值变得无效并导致区块链断裂。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Nonce   | Standing for "Number used Once", this is a number which is generated by miners guessing randomly until they find a number that, when Hashed with the rest of the block data, results in a Hash of the required Difficulty (or higher) to make the Block *Valid*. A Block which does not yet have a Nonce is called a *Block Template*, this can be repeatedly Hashed with different Nonces to try to meet the Difficulty requirement of the coin and form a Block. If two Blocks are found by diffent pools at the same time they are both added to the chain and then the next block will only point its Previous Block Hash at one of these, the other is called an *Uncle*. |
